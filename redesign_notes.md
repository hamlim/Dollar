# Dollar React and Firebase Redesign - Codename Project Flow

## These are the design notes, for design process write to 	`Redesign.md` in the root folder


### Goals:

* Make the web app in React so we can port it to React Native
* To add more functionality to the application including:
	* Income for all account types
	* Expenses for all account types
	* Recurring expenses for all accounts
	* Combined statistics for all accounts
	* new statistics:
		* Burn Rate
		* Forecasting

And probably more along the way

I will be designing the new look and feel in the `/Design/` folder within the sketch documents.
