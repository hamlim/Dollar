# boilerplate
A basic boilerplate for any new project


## Filemap:

### Favicons:

All favicons go in the favicons folder (`./assets/files/omages/favicons/`):
if the favicon is specific to windows, macosx, ios then it goes in the folder it is specific to (windows -> `..../favicons/windows/`)
(ios -> `..../favicons/apple/ios` and macosx -> `..../favicons/apple/osx`)

### Stylesheets:

All stylesheets are either directly linked to "http://example.com/cdn/style.css" or they are placed in `./assets/css/lib` or `./assets/css/`.
The lib directory is saved for only external stylesheets, all internal (site specific stylesheets are placed in the root css folder)

## Scripts:

All scripts follow the same rules as the stylesheets except they are stored in the `./assets/js/` folders.
