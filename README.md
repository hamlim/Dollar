# Financial Manager

This is a small side project that I will write about at sometime in the future. 

If you plan on using this, I suggest cloning the repository, then change the Airtable API calls in the JS files listed below:

```


```

This is being developed in 2016, using [Vue.js](vuejs.org) and with [Milligram](http://milligram.github.io/).

## Architecture

This is some basic notes on the architecture of the application.

The database is going to be hosted on Airtable, and will be connected via Ajax calls. All the data will be rendered on the page via Vue.js.

### Pages:
  1. Index.html
    2. This shows the basic input form for tracking transactions

  2. Analysis.html
    3. This is a basic page to render stats about the total transactions
